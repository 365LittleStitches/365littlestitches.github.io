# Gloves, mittens, handshoes

One of those reoccuring themes that keeps coming back up. How to knit gloves, how did mitten knitting evolve, how do they vary regionally?

What does this regional variation tell us about old (very old?) trade routes, and trading mechanisms, who had freedom to travel

Who had freedom to create for the joy of creation? What evolved as a result of limited trade, or truck-system control, or rebellion?

The Yorkshire Dales gloves (of which I first learned in *awh crap, can't remember the name*) - examples held at the Wordsworth Museum (yet to visit), the Dent museum/shop (in, er, Dent) and the Dales Countryside Museum (in Hawes, an excellent museum for textile history nerds) somehow seem to echo more of Selbu mittens than seems reasonable.

### Dales gloves characteristics
All in my humble opinion, having not fully read *the* book by Angharad Thomas yet

* Fine gauge knitting (cf. the George someone pattern on Ravelry with a 1.5mm needle)
* B&W natural yarns
* Densely patterned

### Selbu mittens characteristics
(again, having only dipped in and out of Anne Bardsgard's Selbu Mittens book, and one of the mitten patterns)
*Chunkier gauge traditionally (maybe?)
* B&W natural yarns
* Densely patterned

I am trying to bear in mind though some of the wise and clear-headed comments that are in one of Alice Starmore's fair-isle books - that certain patterns can be seen as a natural result of the combination of having two distinct yarn colours avaiable, and the learning that dense colourwork makes for a warmer fabric.

I wonder how different the winter climates are in (pre-21C) Selbu region and the Dales - Selbu being coastal and so presumably damper with sub-zero temps moderated, and the Dales being remarkably wild and exposed for how far south they are.

Are the characteristics of the local sheep breeds to each area all that different? Did the timeframe of local-sheep breeds peak at the same time as local knitting styles?
