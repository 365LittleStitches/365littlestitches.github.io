# Maybe it all comes back to Whitby.

The date of Easter was set at the Synod of Whitby in 664 [English Heritage link here](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/whitby-abbey/history-and-stories/easter-and-the-synod-of-whitby/)

Whitby is key to gansey knitting - both in the current era (with the annual gansey-fest known as Propagansey, run by Deb Gillanders) and her Whole Foods store just by the Esk Estuary
being one of few places where you can still buy the 5-ply yarn and long DPNs.

The Whitby art trail with knitters, and netters and herring girls.

The Esk being the only real river of the North York Moors.

The moorland sheep being so key to all of it - but different to dales sheep (cf. Bradford city of culture events, and Calder Valley culture fest events).

The literary heritage (Dracula, of course), Captain Cook, the Abbey and the Whale Bones, and the Jet jewllers, and the kippers. I don't think you can understand ganseys and knit wear as work wear without understanding Whitby.

Whitby is both the coast and the moors - and I don't currently know how to capture that idea in a little more context - but it's a dual heritage and a dual life, in a way that say Scarborough or Goathland don't have.
