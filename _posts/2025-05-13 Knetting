# Knitting, Knotting, Netting, Nalbinding

Yeah. Figure that one out sometime.

Nalbinding is hard, even as someone who knits and crochets reasonably fluently. I'm not there yet, but I want to figure it out enough to make some socks, that are
approximately like the Coppergate sock (and so, in York stitch), but left-handed because I'm lefthanded. Naturally dyed, ofc, too. Perhaps made in a rather chunkier yarn
to wear as slippers. The workshops as part of the York Viking Festival and as part of Spring Into Wool (near Leeds) helped, I'm sort of starting to understand it a little more?
Still a way to go though.

I'd like to figure out netting too. I could make use of a bunch of net bags in cotton yarns - and I've cotton yarns aplenty. I just need to sit with some of
[Sally Pointer's](https://youtu.be/fBnBdnrICQg?feature=shared) and some cups of tea and some patience. Maybe one year I'll even manage to make one with some nettle cordage...

I'd like to get a good handle on the evolution/timeline of the different related techiques too - and did they all evolve from a common source and then move with folk 
all around the world - or did they evolve independently, repeatedly? Didn't crabs evolve multiple times independently? That's a thing, right?
